title: Digital Audio Synthesizer
description:  My senior design project for my Bachelor's degree, which is a Digital Audio Synthesizer that utilizes digital signal processing (DSP) techniques and extensive programming in the STM32 development environment. The device takes user-controlled parameters (adjusted using encoders/buttons) and musical-instrument digital interface (MIDI) signals and uses them to synthesize electronic sounds. The goal was to emulate the standard analog subtractive synthesizer, with at least one oscillator (VCO), filter (VCF), amplifier (VCA), envelope-generator (EG), and low-frequency oscillator (LFO). All the parameters of these different modules of the synthesizer are controllable by the user. Philip Schremp (a fellow EE) was my partner for this project and I had a blast working on this with him!
