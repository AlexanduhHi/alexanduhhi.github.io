title: Digital Audio Synthesizer
description:  My senior design project for my Bachelor's degree: a "Digital Audio Synthesizer" that utilizes digital signal processing (DSP) concepts with embedded systems programming in the STM32 development environment to take in user-controlled parameters using the encoders/buttons and MIDI and synthesize electronic music. The aim was to emulate the standard analog subtractive synthesizer. Philip Schremp (a fellow EE) was my partner for this project and I had a blast working on this with him!
